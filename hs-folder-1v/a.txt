Recommended Best Practices for Using Pub/Sub Topics
Here are some best practices for effectively using Pub/Sub:

1. Designing Topics and Subscriptions
One Topic per Event Type: Keep topics focused on a single type of event to simplify processing.

Use Multiple Subscriptions: Different consumers can have independent subscriptions for flexibility.

Subscription Types:

Pull: The subscriber explicitly requests messages.

Push: Pub/Sub sends messages to an endpoint (like Cloud Functions or Cloud Run).


2. Message Retention and Delivery
Acknowledge Messages Promptly: Subscribers should acknowledge only after processing is complete.

Dead Letter Topics (DLT): Configure Dead Letter Topics to handle unprocessed messages.

Retry Policies: Use exponential backoff for retries in case of failures.


3. Scalability and Performance
Batching & Flow Control: Enable message batching for performance gains.

Parallelism: Use multiple subscribers to scale out processing.

Ordering Keys: If message order is important, use ordering keys within a topic.

Designing an efficient topic and subscription architecture is critical for ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability in a GCP Pub/Sub system. Hereâ€™s how to approach this effectively:

If some messages are critical (e.g., fraud detection alerts), they should have a dedicated topic.


If some messages are critical (e.g., fraud detection alerts), they should have a dedicated topic.

Example:

critical-alerts

logs-info

audit-events

If supporting multiple customers, consider:

Single topic for all tenants (simpler but needs filtering).

One topic per tenant (better isolation, but more complex).

1.4 Use Schema Validation
Use Pub/Sub Schemas to enforce JSON/Avro message formats.

Prevents malformed messages from breaking consumers.
