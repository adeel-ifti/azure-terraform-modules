Stream from Pub/Sub to BigQuery 
This tutorial uses the Pub/Sub Subscription to BigQuery template to create and run a Dataflow template job using the Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI. The tutorial walks you through a streaming pipeline example that reads JSON-encoded messages from Pub/Sub, uses a User-Defined Function (UDF) to extend the Google-provided streaming template, transforms message data with the Apache Beam SDK, and writes the results to a BigQuery table.
